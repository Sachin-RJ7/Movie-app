## Features

### Lazy Loading

The app uses lazy loading to only load images when they are needed. This improves the app's performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded at once.

### Infinite Scrolling

The app uses infinite scrolling to load more movies as the user scrolls down the page. This provides a seamless browsing experience without the need for pagination.

### Search Functionality

The app includes a search bar that allows users to search for movies by title. The search is performed in real-time, and the results are displayed immediately.

### Redux-Toolkit

The app uses redux-toolkit to manage its state. This provides a centralized location for storing and managing data, making it easier to maintain and debug.

### Skeleton Loading

The app uses skeleton loading to display a placeholder UI while data is being fetched. This provides a better user experience by giving users immediate feedback that the app is working.

### Circular Progress Bar

The app includes a circular progress bar that is displayed while data is being fetched. This provides visual feedback to users that the app is working.

### Custom Hooks

The app includes custom hooks that encapsulate complex functionality, making it easier to reuse code and maintain consistency throughout the app.

### Custom Carousel/Slider

The app includes a custom carousel/slider that allows users to browse through a selection of movies. This was implemented without the use of any external libraries, making it lightweight and customizable.

### React Hooks and State Management

The app uses React hooks to manage its state, making it easier to build and maintain complex UIs.

### Fetching Data from Rest API with Axios

The app uses Axios to fetch data from a REST API. This provides a scalable way to retrieve data and makes it easy to swap out the backend if needed.
